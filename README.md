# Determination of the rotation periods of the Eunomia family asteroids according to the ZTF survey data.

### Stack: SQL, Python, Excel, Power Point

### What was done.

1. <b>Excel (IFS/IF, Plot):</b> asteroids that satisfy the required physical parameters were found. Also, statistics were calculated in this environment and graphs were built.

2. <b>SQL (JOIN, WHERE):</b> from the general database and the database obtained as a result of the work in Excel, the search for asteroids belonging to the S taxonomic class was automated.

3. <b>Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib):</b>
	a. A program was created with the help of which the periods of asteroids with a diameter of less than 3 kilometers were determined.
	b. A ​​program was created with the help of which it was possible to determine whether the period of the selected asteroid is known
	c. A graph was created that visually depicts the amount of work done. Presented on a logarithmic scale.

4. <b>Created visualizations (Excel, Python)</b>, for a good perception of information and based on them created a presentation in Power Point

<b>Result: </b><i>created a number of programs with the help of which the rotation periods of small bodies of the Solar System were determined using statistical methods and frequency analysis methods. The result is confirmation of the impact of space weathering on small objects within the same family. In addition, the used integrated approach to the project allowed to identify the root causes of statistical features.</i>
